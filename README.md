# Aphasia-ACT-R-Machine-Learning
Generating synthetic data using QN-ACTR cognitive architecture to train intelligent agents for detecting aphasia using eye-movement data

This repository only provides generated and pre-processed trace data from QN-ACTR (Shi Cao) cognitive architecture. QN-ACTR can model high-level cognitive processes in the human brain and generate synthetic data which can be applied in machine learning.
For this experiment eye-movement information was extracted from a simple reading model. Parameters for language comprehension and reaction times were modified for aphasic samples and mixed with control samples. 
Machine learning was implemented in Python 3.9 using Keras libraries.
